# DDoSPreventionV1
In the code above, we are creating a socket object and binding it to the protected IP and port. We then listen for incoming connections in an infinite while loop. For each incoming connection, we check if the number of connections for the connecting IP has exceeded the maximum allowed connections. If so, we close the connection. Otherwise, we process the request normally and close the connection.

This simple code can be a good starting point for developing more advanced DDoS mitigation tools. It is important to note that this is just one approach and there are many other methods for preventing DDoS attacks, such as rate limiting at the network level and using specialized hardware devices.
